# Individual Ionic App Assignment

Within this folder, use Ionic to create a new hybrid mobile app. You will be demonstrating this app to your fellow classmates.

Your app needs to be able to do the following:
* Hit an external API of your choice to retrieve data and display it to the user.
* Contain navigation between more than one page.

A list of public APIs can be found [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis).
